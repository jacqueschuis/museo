Inspired by YelpCamp by Colt Steele combined with my background/personal interest in art history.

YelpCamp is a full CRUD app built with Node, Express, and Mongo with 3 basic models. There is one basic 'index' and one basic 'show' page.

While **museo** is my first full-stack portfolio piece, I have carefully considered every aspect of its design and code to suit a production-quality app. I want **museo** to be fully usable beyond my portfolio, and I think of it as a passion project that combines my academic background as an art historian with my newfound love of web-development.

With **museo**, I have taken what I learned from YelpCamp and added:

- 4 interconnected data models, each with their own respective indices and show pages.
- Further library integrations: masonryJS, flickity, vanillatilt, imagesLoaded
- More robust validation through Joi and more intricate templating (EJS) of individual pages
- More complex and more dynamic form inputs with JS DOM manipulation
- Atlas search of the three main data models
- Multi-faceted filtering of the three main data models
- Full-UI redesign using Bootstrap and significant amounts of original CSS
